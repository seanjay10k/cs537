---fastsort---
General ideas
Disk IO is slow, therefore must start sorting before having all the data loaded to memory
Naive approach
Create a thread to read from disk, update elements read in memory
Create a thread to sort in memory based on the elements (Merge sort)

---Kernel syscall addition---
Step 1: grep for getpids
Step 2: add a line or two
Step 3: grep for word "tick", uptime syscall found
Step 4: tests
Step 5: ?????
Step 6: profit
